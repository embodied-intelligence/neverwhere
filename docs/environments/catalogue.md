## PolyCam Raw Data Structure

We took these scans from PolyCam, and organize the raw data into the following structure:

- `mesh_info.json`
- `polycam.mp4`
- `raw.glb`
- `thumbnail.jpg`
- `keyframes/`
    - `cameras/`
    - `confidence/`
    - `corrected_cameras/`
    - `corrected_images/`
    - `depth/`
    - `images/`

We list the missing files in [Raw Data Status](catalogue/raw_data_status.md).
